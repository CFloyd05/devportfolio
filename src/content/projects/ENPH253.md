## Overview

The goal of the competition was to build an autonomous robot to 

The robot would autonomously enter the model building, locate and pick up pets, then return them to a safe zone.

## Design

I was responsible for creating the CAD model of our robot.

The primary challenge with the design were the size constraints. We wanted as much internal capacity as possible to hold pets, yet the robot had to fit through the doorway, and we needed to fit the arm mechanisms on the sides.

## Manufacturing

The chasis of the robot was lasercut out of 3mm hardboard. Gears were lasercut from a mix of 1/4" acrylic with a few gear being cut from delrin. Pulleys and many other miscelenous components were 3D printed in PETG.
