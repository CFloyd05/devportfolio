## Project Description

I built this project to create a low cost fume extractor for soldering. I had a goal of making it for cheaper comparable models could be bought online. The fume extractor consists of a 3D printed enclosure designed to hold a PC fan I found in an e-waste bin, along with a commercially available filter.

I made the casing design modular, with M3 threaded inserts on the front and back. This makes the front shroud interchangeable, so I can mount the fume extractor on a tilting stand. It also allows easy mounting of an exaust duct to the rear.

For the filter, I purchased a three stage kit. There's a particle filer, an activated charcoal filter, and a HEPA filter. To improve the fume extractor's airflow and suction abilities, I decided not to use the particle filter.

      data-caption="Three Filtering Stages"
      />

To power the fan, I created a 3D printed enclosure at the end of the fan wire, with an inline switch and barrel connector. This allows me to connect it to a standard 12V power supply.

While the fume extractor is functional as is, a future improvement would be to upgrade to a higher power fan. In it's current state, I need to be soldering somewhat close in order for it to effectively suction the fumes.

Overall, the only major cost were the filters, at $29 CAD. I already had the other materials, such as 3D printer filament, threaded inserts and hardware, switch, and barrel connector. I estimate their cost to be at most a few dollars. I consider this project a success, with comperable models going for at least $40 CAD online.
