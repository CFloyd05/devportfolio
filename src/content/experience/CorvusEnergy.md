## Who's Corvus Energy

Corvus Energy is the worlds leading supplier of batteries for the maritime industry; powering electric and hybrid marine vessels.

## My Role

As part of the prototyping team at Corvus Energy, my role was to design, build, and test prototype parts for their new battery systems. My job responsibilities included: designing parts and assemblies in solidworks; manufacturing parts, often with a Tormac CNC mill or 3D printer; performing tests on various prototype parts and systems; writing thorough documentation for my designs and tests.

## My Projects

#### Battery Lifting Jig

I designed and built this battery lifting jig in preparation for our team to work on a particularly heavy project, requiring the use of a hoist to move the prototype around. I designed the assembly in SolidWorks, making use of off the shelf parts from McMaster Carr and aluminum extrusions.

I machined a few custom parts on the CNC mill, and 3D printed some of the non-structural parts. To validate my design, I ran some FEAs in the local area where the prototype mounted to the jig; the location that I determined to be the weakest point. In the final weeks of my co-op, I made modifications to this jig, such that it could be adapted for the team's next two projects.

#### Battery Testing: Short-Circuit, Thermal Runaway, Vibration



#### Adhesive Testing

Throughout the course of my co-op, I performed several tests involving adhesives. Below are images from a few involing adhesive wetout patterns.

*Left:* A small scale test analyzing wetout of different amounts and patterns of adhesive. *Centre:* The left test was scaled up to full size. I can't show photos of the prototype, however, this is the result of the GCode I wrote for the CNC adhesive dispenser as part of the full scale test. *Right:* I performed several tests to charecterize the adhesive wetout of differet joint geometries.

I also assisted in shear tests of adhesive samples, and charecterization of adhesive performance under different temperature and humidity conditions (not pictured).

#### Pneumatic Press

I designed a pneumatic press to be used in the assembly of battery prototypes.
